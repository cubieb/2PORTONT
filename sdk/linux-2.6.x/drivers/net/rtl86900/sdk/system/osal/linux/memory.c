/* Function Name:
 *      osal_alloc
 * Description:
 *      Allocate memory based on user require size.
 * Input:
 *      size - size of allocate memory
 * Output:
 *      None
 * Return:
 *      pointer of the allocated memory area.
 * Note:
 *      linux - Implemented by using kmalloc with GFP_ATOMIC flag.
 *              The maximum size of memory allocated by kmalloc is 128Kbytes.
 *              kmalloc won't sleep with GFP_ATOMIC flag.
